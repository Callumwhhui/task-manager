## Project Brief 

A working full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

 Incorporate the technologies of the MERN-stack:
  - MongoDB/Mongoose
  - Express
  - React
  - Node
    
  Have a well-styled interactive front-end.
  
Communicates with the Express backend via AJAX.

Implement token-based authentication. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.
  
Implement authorization by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

Have a well-scoped feature-set. Full-CRUD data operations are not required if one or more other features are included, for example:
  - Consume data from a third-party API.
  - Implement additional functionality if the user is an admin.
  - Implementation of a highly dynamic UI or data visualization.
  - Other, instructor approved, complexity/features.
